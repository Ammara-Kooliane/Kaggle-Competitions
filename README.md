# How the repository works

Folders contain scripts created for each of the Kaggle competitions I participated in:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Predict_San_Francisco_crimes: https://www.kaggle.com/c/sf-crime

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Predict_Titanic_survivors: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic

My scripts are also available on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/ammara/scripts?sortBy=votes
